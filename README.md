## Project Overview

* **Purpose:** The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling. By rebuilding an existing static page, I focused on applying core concepts like layout, typography, and visual presentation.
* **Technologies Used:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
* **Limitations:**
    * This project is **non-interactive**; it doesn't include any JavaScript functionality.
    * It is **not responsive** and is designed for desktop viewing only. This was intentional to focus purely on HTML and CSS without the added complexity of responsive design at this stage of learning.
