## Project Overview

* **Purpose:** The primary goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of HTML structure and CSS styling. By rebuilding an existing static page, I focused on applying core concepts like layout, typography, and visual presentation.
* **Technologies Used:**
    * HTML5
    * CSS3
* **Limitations:**
    * This project is **non-interactive**; it doesn't include any JavaScript functionality.

## Why This Project?

As I embark on my journey into web development, recreating existing designs has proven to be an effective way to learn. This project serves as a foundational step, building the necessary skills to understand how web pages are constructed. These skills, particularly understanding the front-end, are crucial for my broader learning path in **cybersecurity**. A solid grasp of how websites work will undoubtedly aid in identifying vulnerabilities and understanding web application security.
